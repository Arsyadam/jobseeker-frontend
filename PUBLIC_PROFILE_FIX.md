# ✅ Public Profile Route Fix

## Problem

The application was crashing with error: `ReferenceError: slug is not defined`

**Root Cause**: The public profile was created at `/app/profile/@[slug]/page.tsx`. In Next.js, folders starting with `@` are reserved for **Parallel Routes**, not dynamic routes. This caused routing conflicts.

## Solution

Moved the public profile page to a clean route structure:

### Before (❌ Broken)

```
/app/profile/@[slug]/page.tsx  → Causes routing error
URL: jobseeker.com/@john-doe
```

### After (✅ Fixed)

```
/app/u/[slug]/page.tsx  → Works correctly
URL: jobseeker.com/u/john-doe
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Public Profile Route

**File**: `/app/u/[slug]/page.tsx`

- Clean dynamic route structure
- Fetches public profile from backend
- Beautiful card-based layout
- Shows: name, avatar, bio, location, skills, experience, education, portfolio
- Hides sensitive data (email, phone)

### 2. Updated Profile Editor

**File**: `/app/profile/page.tsx`

- Changed URL preview from `jobseeker.com/@` to `jobseeker.com/u/`
- Slug validation remains the same (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens)

### 3. Updated Backend Documentation

**File**: `/BACKEND_API_REQUIREMENTS.md`

- Changed endpoint from `GET /api/profile/@:slug` to `GET /api/profile/u/:slug`
- Updated example URLs

## URL Structure

### Public Profiles

- **Old**: `https://jobseeker.com/@john-doe-developer` ❌
- **New**: `https://jobseeker.com/u/john-doe-developer` ✅

### Profile Editor

- **Route**: `/profile`
- **Access**: Protected (requires login)

### Dashboard Routes

- **Jobseeker**: `/dashboard/jobseeker`
- **HRD**: `/dashboard/hrd`

## Backend Endpoint Required

```http
GET /api/profile/u/:slug

Example: GET /api/profile/u/john-doe-developer

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "...",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "profilePicture": "/uploads/...",
    "bio": "Software developer...",
    "location": "Jakarta",
    "skills": ["React", "TypeScript", "Node.js"],
    "experience": "5 years...",
    "education": "Bachelor of CS",
    "portfolioLinks": ["https://github.com/johndoe"],
    "github": "https://github.com/johndoe",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
    "website": "https://johndoe.dev",
    "slug": "john-doe-developer"
    // Note: email and phone are excluded for privacy
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test the Public Profile

1. Go to `/profile` (while logged in)
2. Edit your profile and set a custom slug (e.g., "john-doe")
3. Save the profile
4. Visit `/u/john-doe` to see your public profile
5. Share this URL with others

### Error States Handled

- ✅ Profile not found (404)
- ✅ Backend not available
- ✅ Loading state with spinner
- ✅ Back to home button on error

## Next.js Routing Rules

For future reference:

### ✅ Correct Dynamic Routes

```
/app/users/[id]/page.tsx       → /users/123
/app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx     → /posts/my-article
/app/u/[username]/page.tsx     → /u/john-doe
```

### ❌ Incorrect (Reserved Symbols)

```
/app/@[slug]/page.tsx          → Reserved for Parallel Routes
/app/(group)/[id]/page.tsx     → Parentheses are for Route Groups
/app/_private/page.tsx         → Underscore makes it private
```

## Status

✅ **Fixed** - Application now compiles and runs without errors
✅ **Tested** - No TypeScript errors
✅ **Ready** - Backend team can implement the endpoint
